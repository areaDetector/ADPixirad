Release Notes
=============
R2-2 (2-July-2018)
----
* Added support for the PIXI-III chip
  - New CountMode record to select Normal, NPI and NPISUM count modes.
  - New HitThreshold record to control the VtHit value.
  - Added new pixiradAutoCal iocsh command to set the 7 calibration values unique to each PIII detector.
* Changed AUTOCAL so that it does not read back the calibration images.
  These were not useful, added complexity, and could be confusing to the user.
* Added support for new PVs in ADCore R3-3 in opi files (NumQueuedArrays, EmptyFreeList, etc.)
* Changed configure/RELEASE files for compatibility with areaDetector R3-3.
* Improved op/*/autoconvert/* files with better medm files and better converters.

R2-1 (16-April-2015)
----
* Changes for compatibility with ADCore R2-2.


R2-0 (4-April-2014)
----
* New driver added in this release.
